# Use Directions

Use this directory as a place to store images of locations that correspond to the "Locations" variable in the database.
The program will automatically read `.jpg` and `.png` files placed in this directory. 
A configuration file, `location_fig.txt`, will be created in the main directory if one does not exist. Delete this file and let it regenerate (by running `flask_finder.py`) upon putting new images in this directory. 
To link locations with location names; fill out the config file template, save the file, and refresh the app.
