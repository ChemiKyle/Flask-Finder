Use this directory as a place to store images of locations that correspond to the "Locations" in the database.
The program will automatically read the .jpg and .png files in this directory.
A configuration file "location_fig.txt" will be created in the main dir if one does not exist.
To link locations with location names; fill out the config file template, save the file, and refresh the app.
